# 09 Node.js: Professional README Generator

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions&mdash;this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project. 

You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.

Your task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). Review the [Guide to a Professional README](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma/blob/master/readme-guide.md) as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain. 

The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```
node index.js
```

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. Revisit 2.2.4: Screencastify Tutorial in Module 2 of the **prework** as a refresher on how to record video from your computer. You’ll need to submit a link to the video **and** add it to the README of your project.

Before you start, clone the [starter code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma).

## User Story

```
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```

## Getting Started

Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

* Create a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` so that your `node_modules` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your `.gitignore` file before installing any npm dependencies.

* Make sure that your repo includes a `package.json` with the required dependencies. You can create one by running `npm init` when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.

* Include a video of the typical user flow through your application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.

* Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers or other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.


## Review

You are required to submit the following for review:

* A walkthrough video demonstrating the functionality of the application.

* A sample README.md file for a project repository generated using your application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.


# README Generator

## Description

A Javascript program that generates README and LICENSE files based on the user's choices on questions generated by the program.

This program is ran using Node.js with modules Inquirer and Filesystem that handles the questions and their corresponding answers, and the writing of the files respectively.

### README file

The README file would consist of the following sections:

- Description
- Table of Contents
- Installation
- Usage
- License
- Contributing
- Tests
- Questions

The program is created so that a question is alloted and used for each section. Aside from the sections mentioned, the user would also be asked the project's title, the user's full name, github username, and email that would be used for the title and questions sections.

The Description and Contributing sections would be entered in the text file generated by Inquirer module instead of inline. The Table of Contents would have links to the other sections. Installation, Usage, and Tests sections would contain the code that needs to be run for the corresponding task. License section would contain the license to grant permission to use, modify, and share the software created. Questions section would contain the ways on where the user can be contacted and their Github repository.

### LICENSE file

The LICENSE file would be created if the user selects a license other than None and is generated based on the license selected.

## Demonstration/Sample File

The program is run in the command line and the user needs to answer questions that will be used to generate the README and LICENSE files.
